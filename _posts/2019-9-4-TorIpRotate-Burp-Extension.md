title: TorIpRotate Burp Extension
---

Today we are releasing our first Extension for Burpsuite. This extension can help you to rotate the IP address of your current Tor Exit Node.
If you need different source IP addresses for your testing, eg. your object under test enforces source IP based rate limiting, this extension will make you quite happy :)
See [README](https://github.com/starhackerz/toriprotate/blob/master/README.md).
